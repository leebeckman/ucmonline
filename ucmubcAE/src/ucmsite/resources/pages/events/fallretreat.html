        At the beginning of every school year, UCM retreats for a weekend away to enjoy connection, worship,
        epic late night games, new friends, quiet times of prayer, hikes, s'mores by the fire and teaching from
        scripture. If you are new to UCM this year, this retreat is one of the best ways to meet new friends and
        bring Christ into the center of your academic year.

    <subheader>THEME & GUEST SPEAKER:</subheader>
    <text>
        The teaching sessions at the retreat will be focused on our theme passage for 2009-2010: <i>We desire to be
        a community in prayer, in worship, in discipleship, in fellowship, and in witness as modeled by the early
        church of Acts 2:42-47.</i> 
    </text>

        Our guest speaker this year, Brad Jersak, will be sharing on how we see Jesus in one another, and in our
        neighbour.

        Brad is author of Can You Hear Me?, teacher at Fresh Wind Christian Fellowship in Abbotsford and coeditor
        of the <i>Clarion Journal for Spirituality and Justice</i>. Through his books and seminars, Brad teaches that
        anyone can learn to hear God's voice through the simple practice of "listening prayer." Brad believes that
        those who begin to listen will find that God's love will heal wounded hearts and empower them to pass on
        that healing to this broken world.

    <subheader>LOCATION & TRANSPORTATION:</subheader>  
    <text>
        Camp Capilano is located in North Vancouver, just north of the suspension bridge. We will be traveling as a
        group on the public bus. Bring your U-Passes! We will leave by 6pm on Friday. We will load our sleeping
        bags and pillows in a few cars and carry our backpacks with us on transit (so only pack what you need for
        the weekend). On Sunday we'll hop on the bus again, leaving the camp by 1pm and returning to UBC
        around 2:30pm.

    <subheader>FOOD & LODGING</subheader>
    <text>
        Food and lodging are all covered in the cost. We'll have a late night snack on Friday, so please eat before
        you head out. On Sunday we'll have breakfast and a leftover lunch before we return to UBC. It's a good
        idea to bring a water bottle. The lodging is dorm style with bunk beds, with a capacity for 40 students. So
        register early!
