    <text>
        In biblical history, the people of God often took journeys away from the city, up mountains, to the summit,
		in order to meet with God. On a mountain was where Moses met God, and later he would return to
		another mountain top experience to gain guidance and receive teaching from God.

    <text>
    	For several years now, we have been inviting members of the UCM community to come back to University
		early in order to receive teaching, training, and a heart for God's mission to the campus. We are excited
		to embark on another Summit experience this Fall 2010.
