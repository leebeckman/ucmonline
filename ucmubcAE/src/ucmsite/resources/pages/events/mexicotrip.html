    <header>UCM Mexico Trip - 2009</header>
    
    <text>
        Ola! For the last 4 years UCM has been traveling down to the Baja of Mexico to impact and be impacted by the people and town of Vicente Guerrero.  We have connected with Absolute Leadership Development Inc. and participated in their "Hero Holiday" program that centered around building a home for a family in need. We will be returning to the Baja again this spring, flying down to San Diego and traveling by van to Vicente on May 1st and returning May 10th.

    	Our vision this year is to see 24 students from UCM's across BC experience this incredible trip, as we build two houses for two separate families!  As well, we hope to raise $10,000 specifically for the house building needs. We are also gathering a team of 10 together to volunteer at the orphanage in Vicente Guerrero.
