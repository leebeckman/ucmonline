        UCM is not just another place to receive, but it's also a place to serve. Serving others with our talents and
        resources is one of the ways God has called us to be His hands and feet. Whether on Thursday Nights or during
        the week, whether behind the scenes or up front, whether it is taking on a responsibility or just lending a hand,
        there are plenty of ways you can serve the UCM community. Check out the areas below to find the volunteer
        opportunities that best match your skills and fit your availability.

        One of the ways we try to build community is by hosting UCM dinners before our Thursday Night gatherings. If
        you have a passion for food, meal planning, grocery shopping, or just want to pitch in, volunteer as
        one of our chefs or cooks. If you love to bake, maybe you would like to help provide snacks after TNT. Contact
        our chef directly to find out how you can help. <email>chefs@ucmonline.ca</email>

        On Thursday Nights we are in need of members who can give announcements, either live or on video. If you are
        not camera shy, maybe you would like to help plan and execute one of our videos. Maybe your gift is more with a
        pen and paper, or graphic design. We are always looking for creative people to help with our promotions and
        adverts. For larger events we often poster the campus and need a team of people who love staplers and the
        great outdoors. If you have mad skills with a laptop, our webmaster is looking for help maintaining the website.
        Many of these skills and abilities transfer to simple ways to reach out to our campus. Contact our outreach
        coordinator to be involved in any of our upcoming outreach programs. <email>outreach@ucmonline.ca</email>

        When your family is as big as ours, there is always some level of planning going on behind the scenes. The social
        committee, a.k.a. the "soco," are the master-minds behind our large events, banquet dinners, and community
        nights. If you have a passion for bean counting or capturing the moment, we are always looking for help with the
        finances or photography. Contact our social coordinator to find out ways you can help with the party planning.

        Each year UCM has been well known for its participation in UBC intramurals. Let our sports coordinator know if
        you would like to head up a team. <email>sports@ucmonline.ca</email>

        There are several roles you can help us with before, during, and after our Thursday Night gathering. Musicians
        and vocalists can contact our music coordinator about gettng involved with the worship band. If you have any
        experience doing sound or are willing to learn, we are always in need of people to run the sound during practices
        and during our worship time. As well, there is always a media operator giving the cues for our announcements,
        lyrics, and lecture notes. If you are that rare student that owns a car, we are always in desperate need of
        someone willing to be our transportation driver. If your vehicle has a trunk, then we could use it. One of the
        easiest ways to be involved before or at the end of a Thursday night is to pitch in with set-up and tear-down.
        Contact our music coordinator if you are interested in serving on a Thursday Night. <email>music@ucmonline.ca</email>

        What has God taught you on your spiritual journey, or what has he been teaching you lately? You can serve
        others by taking what you are learning and offering it to your peers through mentoring or discipleship. Our vision
        is to see every student in our ministry seeking to be discipled by Christ through an intentional discipleship
        relationship with another. Contact our staff if you would like to serve others in this community through
        mentoring or co-leading a discipleship group. <email>ubcstaff@ucmonline.ca</email>
