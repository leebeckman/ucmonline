    <subheader>WHAT IS CORE?</subheader>
    <text>
        Core refers to our discipleship groups. It is so named because we believe that meeting in a small group for the
        sake of mutual growth is "core" to our vision of community at UCM. Much more than just a bible study, Core is
        the location where the substance of our community life happens. It is a place to know others deeply, to learn
        together, to share how your week is going, and to pray for and worship with one another. Most Core groups
        are around 6 to 10 people and meet weekly in dorm rooms across the campus throughout the academic year.

    <subheader>WHY SHOULD I JOIN A CORE?</subheader>
    <text>
        Core enables you to go further. It can be difficult, or even impossible to find and develop real community in
        large group settings. Getting involved in a small group will help you form lasting friendships that extend
        beyond the weekly meeting.

        Core is a place to find community with others curious about God. It is a safe place to ask questions. It is a place
        for discipleship. It is a place to share the good and the bad times. And most importantly it is a place for you to
        live out the mission of God alongside others.

    <subheader>HOW DO I GET INVOLVED IN A CORE?</subheader>
    <text>
        Find a Core in the lists above (Men's, Women's, and International Groups). Contact the leader and go check it
        out. Most of our members sign-up for a Core at our first Thursday Night gathering of the year, after our
        Welcome BBQ.
