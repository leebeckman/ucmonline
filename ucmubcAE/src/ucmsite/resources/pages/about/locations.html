        UCM is a community of people constantly on the move. But here are some directions to the locations where you
        can typically find us gathering:

        The Woodward Instructional Resource Centre is located on Health Sciences Mall beside UBC Hospital. It can be a
        tricky building to find. The entrance to the building is tucked in the middle of the block beside the hospital and
        behind the Shoppers Drug Mart. If you're coming from Totem, head down Agronomy Road and take a left on
        Health Science Mall (one street past East Mall) and head right after the Hospital. If you're coming from Vanier,
        head to the bookstore and take a right down East Mall and cut over after the Pharmacy building. If you're coming
        from Gage, head down Wesbrook Mall and after you pass the Shoppers Drug Mart, go through the passage way
        on your right. <!-- <map title="View map to Woodward" imageurl="images/content/mapimages/woodward.png" docurl="" />-->

        The Gerard House is home to six UCM leaders and is often a location where smaller and informal UCM
        gatherings happen. It also happens to be where the UCM staff office is located as well. Use the door on the left
        side of the house to access the office. If you're trying to visit the guys, please ring the front door. As this is their
        home, please respect their privacy, but you're welcome to poke your head in our staff office anytime we're
        around.

        The house is located kitty-corner to Shoppers Drug Mart, adjacent to the Lutheran Campus Centre. You'll find the
        house at the end of a small parking lot. Regent College, next door to University Village (McDonald's) is right
        across the street. <!-- <map title="View map to GHouse" imageurl="images/content/mapimages/ghouse.png" docurl="" />-->

        The UCM student office can be found in the Student Union Building (SUB) on the NE corner behind the cafeteria,
        room 113. All the student offices are tricky to find. One way to find it is to come in the north doors to the SUB,
        head left through the cafeteria and enter the doors at the back of the cafeteria. Room 113 is then the first office
        on your right (next door to the ski club office). Another way to find it would be if you're coming out of the south
        end of the SRC, enter the doors directly across and right of the cafeteria.
