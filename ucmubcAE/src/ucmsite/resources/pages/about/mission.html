        Worshipping God is the highest call of Christians. We are Christ's family, created by God. We love and serve God,
        share His greatness with the world, and thank Him for the love and kindness that He has shown us. We worship
        Him in our daily activities.

    </text>
    <text>
        We want to allow our hearts and lives to continually be examined by God as we pray from a posture of faith and
        humility for our needs and the needs of our campus community.

        "In the same way I loved you, you love one another" (John 13:34). Jesus' love, modeled for us by His relationship
        with His disciples, is our motivation to pursue community with each other. No believer is 'an island', but rather a
        member of the Body, united by the Holy Spirit. We love, pray for, support, and care for each other. This love is
        enabled by the Holy Spirit, and produces harmony in relationships.

        <highlight>Discipleship</highlight>
    </text>
    <text>
        We seek to help students build Christian maturity in their lives through Bible Study, prayer, service, developing
        spiritual gifts, and leadership opportunities. We believe that discipleship is best accomplished in the relational
        context of mentorship. We desire to instill a continuing legacy of developing leaders who are equipped for the
        work of Christ in the collegiate community, which will continue in the local church beyond graduation.

        Have you ever observed something so spectacular, unusual, or unbelievable, that you began telling everyone you
        knew about it? We embrace Christ's mission to mobilize, equip, and send each student to fulfill their distinct
        calling from God to make an impact for a lifetime - whether in their own sphere of influence, the marketplace, or
        in the broader framework of the world.
