    <header>Giving to UCM</header>
    
    <text>
    	University Christian Ministry at UBC is situated on a campus of over 49,000 students, faculty and staff. People
		come from all over the world to work and study at this University. Statistics show that Vancouver has the least
		number of people who regularly attend a church in all of North America. The further you travel West, the less
		churched people are. With UBC situated on the most Western part of our city, UCM is ministering to one of the
		least evangelized mission fields in North America.

	<text>
		Like many ministry organizations, UCM depends upon the support of individuals and churches in order for us to
		do the mission God has called us to on the UBC Campus.

	<subheader>HOW DO I SUPPORT UCM?</subheader>
	
	<text>
		You can support UCM through prayer and by giving financially toward this ministry. The salaries of our staff and
		interns depend entirely upon the consistent giving of individuals and churches. Additionally, we are required to
		raise finances annually for our office and ministry expenses, and each year our student executive prayerfully set
		a budget for the ministry needs of their student initiatives. Below are three convenient ways you can support
		UCM:
