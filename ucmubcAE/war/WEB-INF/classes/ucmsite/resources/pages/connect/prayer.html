    <header>Prayer</header>
    <text>
Our desire is that prayer be the foundation of everything we do at UCM. We believe that prayer is at the heart of
Christianity, because at the heart of Christianity is relationship with God. Relationship implies a two way street;
something we're intimately involved in. The simple act of communicating with God deepens our relationship
with Him.

        It is our prayer that UCM will not only be a place for you to enter into authentic community with others, but that
        we will be able to provide opportunities for you to strengthen your relationship with God, and to make Him part
        of your everyday life. Below are some avenues for you to gather with others to pray:

        Each semester students have been gathering in their faculties on lunch hours and between classes to pray for
        their classmates, each other, and the specific challenges and hopes they have within their faculty. Check the
        above google doc for a gathering in your faculty, or consider starting one! If you'd like your prayer gathering
        added here, simply email prayer@ucmonline.ca and let us know the details.

    <subheader>PRAYER ON THURSDAY NIGHTS</subheader>
    <text>
        Everyone is welcome to come early on a Thursday Night, at 6:45pm, as we pray for the evening, our time of
        worship, for God's word to be spoken through our speaker, and for transformation to occur in the lives of those
        students coming. The staff and the worship band gather to pray together on the side of the stage every week, so
        please feel free to join them.

    <subheader>COMMUNITY FAST & PRAYER</subheader>
    <text>
        UCM has annually set aside a 24 hour period of prayer and fasting as a community. If you've never fasted before
        this is a great opportunity to practice this spiritual discipline alongside those in this community. Stay tuned to
        our announcements for the next community fast & prayer event.
