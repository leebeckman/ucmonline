        Are you looking to engage the university community and enjoy some sports or recreational exercise all at the
        same time? Every year UCM organizes teams to be involved in UBC REC. Yet another way to get to know people,
        and get a little exercise. It is a chance to bring the love of Christ to others with sportsmanship and genuinely
        good times, and to have a blast building community in an active environment.

        hammerers, swimmers, climbers, and slide-in-the-mud-ers (no experience required), sign up and come on out!
