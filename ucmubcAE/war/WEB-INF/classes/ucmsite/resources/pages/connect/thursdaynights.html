        Every Thursday Night during the academic year we gather together as a community. Most weeks it is a time to
        worship God together, to receive teachings from scripture, and to hear from one another as well. Frequently we
        host guest speakers or hear from the staff about how to follow Jesus while at University and other challenges we
        face at this time in life. Occasionally, Thursday Nights might be a completely different format, like when we host
        a banquet dinner or a purely social night. So be sure to check our calendar for details.
