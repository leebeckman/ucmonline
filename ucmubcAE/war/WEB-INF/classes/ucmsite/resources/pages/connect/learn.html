        UCM is a learning community. We believe that studying the Bible and seeing the world through the story of
        scripture helps us know God better and know who he created us to be. As university students we aspire to be life
        long learners, and we realize we were made to live for something larger than our degrees.

    <subheader>A FOUNDATION FOR CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP</subheader>

    <text>
        This is a 10 week course designed to help UCM students to: grow in their love for God, grow in their knowledge
        of God and to better understand God's purpose for His people. The course will help students understand what it
        means to be a Christian disciple, why Jesus discipled others and what it means to obey Jesus' Great Commission
        to go and make disciples. This course is open to all students and will be held on campus at lunch time for one
        hour beginning the third week of the academic year. (*Because this is a foundations course we recommend that
        all UCM student leaders take this course to help them better understand God's call upon UCM as a community
        and upon the individual students that make up UCM.)
