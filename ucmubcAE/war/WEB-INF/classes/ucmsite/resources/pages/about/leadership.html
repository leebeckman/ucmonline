        UCM is a student-led ministry that operates under the guidance and wisdom of a campus director and pastoral
		staff. The staff, and your UCM Student Exec work closely
		together to pray for, organize, and facilitate the ministry on campus. Our Core bible study leaders meet regularly
		with our staff for discipleship and shepherd many students in their weekly meetings in dorms across campus. As
		well, our Worship leaders meet regularly with their worship bands to pray and prepare to lead our community in
		worship each Thursday night. Countless others volunteer in a variety of roles to bring breath and depth to this
		active and diverse community.

				Hi there!
			</text>
			<text>
				Hope y'all had a great summer--I've been studying, working, and otherwise generally having fun back in my hometown of Calgary, Alberta. Still, I'm glad to be back for another great year.
			</text>
			<text>
				I'm heading into my fourth and final year studying Human Geography. In my free time, I love going for coffee (or other coffee-related beverages), reading a good fantasy/science fiction novel, or taking a good old-fashioned nap. Oh, I also enjoy random questions a lot--you never know what you're going to learn about someone when you ask them what kind of exotic animal they'd like to be, and why. (For the record: definitely a wolf--romping, teamwork, intense community--doesn't that sound like the life?)
			</text>
			<text>
				Through UCM, God's been teaching me a lot about living in community--living alongside people who really love and care about you, and aren't afraid to challenge you when you might be wrong. People who will call you up to get the aforementioned coffee and chat about life, or send you a facebook message just to encourage you in your daily life.
			</text>
			<text>
				Come on out to UCM one of these nights, and we'd all love to meet you! I'm looking forward to seeing you there...
			</text>
			<text>
				Love,
			</text>

				Christine

				Hello, hello!
			</text>
			<text>
				Welcome to UCM! I'm Steph, and I'm studying Commerce (accounting, to be specific, but I generally try to avoid the look of pity that people give me whenever I say that...what can I say? I think it's a lot more fun than people give it credit for! Or would that be a debit? Hahaha! ...please don't mind me. Moving on.)
			</text>
			<text>
				Anyway, when I first moved to UBC from Calgary, it was both exhilarating and frightening at the same time - exhilarating because I had the opportunity to start a brand new chapter of my life, and frightening because I had absolute no idea where to begin. Thankfully, it wasn't long before I found a community of genuine and welcoming people at UCM who were also seeking to live a life worth living, and I've been part of this dynamic group ever since!
			</text>
			<text>
				I really hope that you'll find that community that supports and encourages and inspires you, and if it happens to be UCM, all the better for us! ;) So, if you happen to see me milling around, whether at UCM or not, please do say hi - I'd love to meet you!
			</text>
			<text>
				Love and blessings,

				Hello and Welcome!
			</text>
			<text>
				My name is Steven and I proudly hail from scenic Nelson in the West Kootenays. I'm in my third year at UBC, but in the second year of my program, and I'm studying chemistry, biochemistry and latin.  I love sports, especially ones that involve other people, and so you'll often find me playing ultimate frisbee, one of the great discoveries I've made while living on UBC's beautiful campus.
			</text>
			<text>
				I have the honor this year of encouraging and promoting prayer within the UCM community.  I believe that God wants us to know him.  Not just to know about him, but to actually know him.  As we come to know God, our will becomes conformed to his.  The conformation of our will to his means that God's heart becomes our heart, his desires become our desires and the way we live our lives reflects his will... and all of it is for God's glory.  I think that prayer is the primary means by which this conformation occurs, and so it really is my privilege and joy to encourage you and others to pray.  And so I am eagerly looking forward to what God will do in and through the individuals of this community in the coming year.

			<text>
				Hi everyone!
			</text>
			<text>
				My name's Sarah, and I'm a 4th year English Lit and History student.  Unlike last year, when I vehemently denied I would ever be a teacher, I've finally accepted my fate and declared myself a future high school English teacher.  Go figure.  I'm a bit of a transient, having moved around a lot in the past few years, but I absolutely love Vancouver and the communities I've found here.  I adore a good cup of tea or coffee, late night conversations, spontaneity, trying out new foods, pick-up volleyball, and plunking out whatever comes to mind on the piano or the guitar. 
			</text>
			<text>
				I'm excited to be the music coordinator this coming year.  It's important as a community to come together to worship God, whether it be at TNT, in a core, or even between two people jamming on their guitars. I can't wait to see how God shapes and changes our community this coming year, and what type of worship will pour from us as a result.  
			</text>
			<text>
				Here's looking forward to an incredible year!

			<text>
				Hey, this is Tristan and for those who have never seen my mug before, here's a little about me. I grew up in a little town you haven't heard of and moved here a few years ago to begin schooling at UBC. I'm in my third year engineering and loving every long day of it. Although the only extreme sport I'm involved in at UBC is Math I do enjoy beach volleyball, soccer, mountain biking and anything to do with a frisbee. And I prefer snow over rain.
			</text>
			<text>
				I'm the outreach coordinator at UCM which means I'm involved with letting people know what Christians are about and why. This year's going to be awesome so swing by some time and check us out. I'm always up for meeting new people so if you see me around give me a shout!

			<text>
				Thanks for checking us out! Or rather, thanks for checking this club out. I wouldn't want to assume an ulterior motive or anything of the sort...
			</text>
			<text>
				By the looks of it, you may think that I'm a prodigious sixteen year old, but actually, I'm just a vertically challenged fourth year. I love every sport, except for those tiring pointless ones like long distance running or swimming. Like Steve, I enjoy ultimate frisbee, but unlike Steve, I'm actually decent (just joking...Steve can outhuck me any day).
			</text>
			<text>
				Over the last couple years, I've learned about and experienced the richness of Christian friendships through UCM. The university setting is such a unique and rare chance to ground yourself and actually start to live out what you believe. I believe that university Christian clubs (whether ours or the plethora of other ones at UBC) are a great place to find support in this endeavour.
			</text>
			<text>
				This year I'm UCM's treasurer. Unfortunately, I found out last year that this title does not mean I'm in charge of leading expeditions to find hidden treasures. However, it does mean that I'll be processing money and dealing mainly with the bureaucratic side of of things. Which is almost as exciting.
			</text>
			<text>
				If you've gone this far in your research to find Christian community, you might as well go a little bit further and come out! We hope that you'll feel challenged, encouraged, and loved.

				Every year we're excited about what God has in store for us as a UCM community. This community is unique. It's 
				a safe place for students to ask questions about the meaning of life and it's a community that encourages students 
				to grow both mentally and spiritually.
			</text>
			<text>
				Our lives were transformed by God when Arthur met Him as a student at UBC and Janice while in Malaysia just 
				before entering university in England. After a few years of working using our degrees we met each other at Regent College - 
				and as they say - the rest is history.
			</text>
			<text>
				It's our hope that many others will experience His great love while they study on this Campus. One of our deepest 
				desires is to help people grow in their relationship with the One who gives abundant life. It's a wonderful time to 
				be involved with God in the lives of students!

			<text>
				A prairie boy from birth, this lad ventured to the big city of Brandon, MB to seek out his 
				interests in Business and Computer Science (BBA). His passion for campus ministry began with 
				his own transformation at University, where he discovered that Christ was not only calling 
				him to be a disciple, but to go and make disciples.
			</text>
			<text>
				Drawn out "West" for a season of study at Regent College, it was in Vancouver that James would 
				rub elbows with scholarly giants, develop many international friendships, and crystallize 
				his love of movie making and studying film. But on completing his Master's in Christian 
				Studies, he couldn't keep himself away from what has developed to be his personal mission 
				statement: investing in students lives so that they would not only know and grow in the 
				Mystery Message of Jesus, but impart it to their neighbors, and see His transformation on 
				their campus, the marketplace, and the world.
			</text>
			<text>
				Like most people, James wants to change the world. But he's going about it differently then most: 
				the upside down, great reversal way of following the Mystery Message way of Jesus: by serving. 
				Some say it is strategic to be doing this with the future leaders of the world, but the process 
				is slow, one student and one coffee at a time.
			</text>
			<text>
				(By the way James doesn't really like coffee, but he's always open to "go for coffee" with students 
				who aren't afraid to ask the bigger - but more often basic - questions of life.)

			<text>
				Born and raised in the small town of Castor Alberta.  I think the
				claim to fame for my home town is that our sports team is named the
				Castor Raiders (say it together really quickly and you'll get it).
				After graduating High School I planned for a year at Full Gospel
				Bible College in Eston, SK but one year turned into four and a degree
				in Biblical Studies.  I then made the arduous trek in a U-haul truck
				to Vancouver BC, where I began work on a Master's of Christian
				Studies at Regent College.
			</text>
			<text>
				Three years and one degree later, I sit  
				here writing a bio so that you can know me a bit better.  Well at a  
				glance there is the overly passionate devotion to country music, an  
				embarrassing fondness for Molly Ringwald movies, and deep love for a  
				comfy chair and a good book.  But what defines my life is the fact  
				that I believe in relationships and their power to inspire maturity  
				in Christ which is why I am excited to be working with UCM and to be  
				able to encourage and equip people to grow in their relationship with  
				the Lord as well as bring the good news to the world.

				As a gal who was born and raised in the lovely suburb of Coquitlam, 
				I grew up playing pretty much every sport in the book. I also played 
				the flute for a few years, but alas, my musical talents were not 
				discovered at an early age and I was forced to give it up. It was 
				not until after high school (and my failed musical career) that I 
				ventured out to UBC and the big noisy city of Vancouver with the 
				goal of broadening my prospects for employment. After completing a 
				degree in Human Geography and Sociology, however, I decided to stick 
				around to enjoy more of the UCM community at UBC. It is my hope that 
				through UCM, students will have the opportunity to grow in their 
				relationship with Christ and learn to live it out as they participate 
				in authentic Christian community. I am excited about what God is 
				already doing on this campus and look forward to being a part of 
				what He has in store!

			<text>
				I grew up the son of a pastor. My upbringing was fantastic, but I never 
				thought I would follow in my father's footsteps. However when I moved to 
				Vancouver two years ago to pursue a musical opportunity with my sister, 
				God surprised me. I met my wife Kari who at the time was not a Christian. 
				Through the course of our friendship, Kari ended up accepting Jesus. The 
				experience opened my eyes anew to the beauty and power of the Gospel. I 
				wanted to take what I had learned and disciple others. That is when I 
				learned about UCM. I feel inspired to train Christian students to understand 
				their faith and to encourage them to create relationships with students both 
				within and outside of the UCM community. So it ends up that I became what I
				never thought I would be. To my delight, I feel right at home!
