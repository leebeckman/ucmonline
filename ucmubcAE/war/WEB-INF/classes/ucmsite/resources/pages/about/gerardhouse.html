    <text>
        Home to six male student leaders, the purpose of the UCM Gerard House is to provide an intentional Christian
		community for UBC students where the residents are committed to doing life together, while also fostering a
		place where current and future potential UCM student leaders can grow in their Christian walk.
    </text>
    <text>
    	Our vision for the UCM Gerard House is that each of its members would be growing in the areas of spiritual
		maturity, community living, the disciplines of work and study, and the desire to be missional on their campus.
