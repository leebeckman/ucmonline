        Over the last five years we have seen almost 100 students from the UCM community graduate from UBC. Similar
        to our desire to be a relationally based ministry, our desire is to maintain relationships with those who have been
        sent out of our ministry. It is our vision to stay connected with these students, as ministers in the marketplace
        and the world, to encourage them with good news about the ongoing ministry at UBC and to inform them of
        how they can best continue to support this ministry.

    <subheader>UCM REUNION</subheader>
    <text>
        On May 23rd, 2009 we hosted our first UCM Reunion and we had a wonderful time reconnecting with old friends
        and hearing about the journey UCM has been on over the last 5 years. We hope to host another reunion in the
        future and reconnect with another generation of UCM alumni.
