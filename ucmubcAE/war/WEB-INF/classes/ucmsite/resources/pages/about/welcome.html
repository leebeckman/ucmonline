        University Christian Ministries (UCM) is an interdenominational Christian student club at UBC. We strive to assist
        students in their desire to know Jesus and apply his teachings to their lives.

        Christianity is about life -- real living in a real world. A lot of people like to say that university life isn't the real
        world, but that just isn't so. Our time in university is simply a different world from the one in the work force.
        We're faced with a lot of simultaneous pressures -- paper and lab deadlines, a new home with new roommates,
        new questions and new doubts -- that make life at university challenging. It is precisely our life at university that
        Christianity deals with, not just the life beyond. And that is why UCM is here.

        We're a community made up of students who are constantly on the move. Our Core groups meet weekly in dorm
        rooms and lounges all across campus. On Thursday nights we gather as a tribe, often for a time of worship and
        teaching. Other times it might be a social event or banquet dinner. We also own a community house on campus
        called the Gerard Ministry House. The "Ghouse" is home to many of our student leaders as well as our staff
        office. Often people hang out here after our meeting time on Thursdays. Prayer groups are happening in many
        different faculties and students are gathering together to both serve this community as well as the campus in a
        variety of ways.
